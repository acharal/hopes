    Preliminaries
    1. Symbols
        1.1. Constants
        1.2. Function symbols
        1.3. Predicate symbols
        1.4  Variables
    2. Logical connectives (usually builtin)
        2.1 implication ":-"
        2.2 conjuction  ","
        2.3 disjuction  ";"
    3. Quantifiers (forall, exists)

    Basics

    1. a term is an expression of type i
    2. a literal is an expression of type o
    3. an atom is a positive literal
    4. a formula is literals connected by logical connectives. Is of type o.
        4.1 a formula is called closed if has no free variables, namely all
            variables occurs in the formula, are quantified (or bound by lambda abstraction).
    5. a clause is either a fact or a rule
    6. a rule is a *special* formula has only one positive literal, aka A <- B_1, ..., B_n.
       where A is called the head of the rule and [B_1, ..., B_n] (connected by conjuction)
       called the body of the rule.
    7. a fact is a bodyless rule.
    8. a goal is a *special* formula that has no positive literals, aka <- G_1, ..., G_n.
       an empty goal is known as *contradiction*.

    Convensions of Prolog

    1. variables are denoted by *symbols* where their first letter is capital.
    2. Every variables (as defined in 1.) that occurs in a clause is implied to be
       universally quantified.
