i.   handle correctly anonymous symbols aka '_'
         1. Translate anonymous symbols at the very beginning (before typechecking) to fresh with-name symbols
         2. Keep anonymous symbols till the proof procedure at handle respectively

ii.  handle more elegant (and extensively) buildin special symbols.
     special symbols may have also *special* pretty printing

iii. decide whether Syntax should be wrapped into Located or Loc will be integrated inside structures.
     pros: a lot unLoc will be removed.

iv.  interactive user commands and completion Functions

v.   decide whether Hopl should be our general Core language, or should be infer impl-depend lang.
     All operations will take place knowing the Syntax grammar.
     Infer module will take a Syntax tree, transform it into a Hopl tree (the same occur for the goal)
     and then do the inference procedure (each time we want to infer something we have to retransform whole syntax tree?)
