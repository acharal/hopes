TODO List

i.   handle correctly anonymous symbols aka '_'
         1. Translate anonymous symbols at the very beginning (before
            typechecking) to fresh with-name symbols
         2. Keep anonymous symbols till the proof procedure at handle
            respectively
     Current Status:
	Anonymous Symbols are carried all the way to the inference procedure.
        In |variant| function, binds for '_' occur but no anonymous symbol is
        actually substituted because of the non-equality of anonymous symbols
        (if substitution happen would be problematic).
        I think that this behaviour is quite convenient but the correct handle
        should be to change the implementation of |variant| completelly.

ii.  handle more elegant (and extensively) buildin special symbols.
     special symbols may have also *special* pretty printing

iii. decide whether Syntax should be wrapped into Located or Loc will be
     integrated inside structures.
     Current Status: implementated using Located
     Pros(+)/Cons(-)/Invariants(=) of integrate Loc into syntax:
	+ a lot of unLoc calls will be removed
		+ slightly better performance since no calls of unLoc
		+ cleaner code at typechecker
	- we have to change Parser and remove |located| that was quite elegant.
	= Syntax will not be more cleaner or more independent in any case. That
          is sad.

iv.  interactive user commands and completion Functions

v.   decide whether Hopl should be our general Core language, or should be infer
     impl-depend lang.
     All operations will take place knowing the Syntax grammar.
     Infer module will take a Syntax tree, transform it into a Hopl tree (the
     same occur for the goal)
     and then do the inference procedure (each time we want to infer something
     we have to retransform whole syntax tree?)
